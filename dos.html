    <h1>Understanding Denial-of-Service Attacks</h1>
    <p>These attacks aim to make a network or service unavailable to its intended users, typically by overwhelming it with a flood of illegitimate requests.</p>
    
    <div class="row top-row">
        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>What is a Denial-of-Service Attack?</h2>
            <p>A Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack involves attackers sending high volumes of data requests to a network to crash systems and prevent legitimate user access.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>Main Issues Caused by Denial-of-Service Attacks</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Disruption of Services:</strong> Critical online services can be temporarily unavailable, affecting business operations and customer trust.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Resource Drainage:</strong> Resources are consumed by handling the influx of bogus requests, degrading performance for legitimate users.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Financial Losses:</strong> Companies may incur significant costs due to operational disruption and efforts to mitigate the attack.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Reputational Damage:</strong> Repeated attacks can harm an organization's reputation, leading to loss of clients or decreased user base.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Examples of Denial-of-Service Attacks</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Buffer Overflow Attacks:</strong> Overloading the target system's memory buffer to cause crashes or erratic behavior.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>ICMP Flood:</strong> Overwhelming the target with ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) Echo Request (ping) packets, thereby preventing legitimate network traffic.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>SYN Flood:</strong> Exploiting the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) handshake by sending a large number of SYN (synchronize) requests to a target's system and not completing the handshake.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Prevention Tips for Denial-of-Service Attacks</h2>
        <p>To <strong>protect</strong> yourself from Denial-of-Service Attacks, <strong>follow</strong> these essential steps:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Implement Network Security Measures:</strong> Use firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and anti-malware tools to detect and block malicious traffic.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Enhance Bandwidth:</strong> Increase your network bandwidth to handle unexpected spikes in traffic, which can mitigate the impact of an attack.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Employ Load Balancers:</strong> Distribute incoming network traffic across multiple servers to reduce pressure on any single server.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Plan for Redundancy:</strong> Design network architecture with redundancy to ensure service continuity in case of an attack.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Monitor and Respond:</strong> Continuously monitor network traffic for unusual activities and have an incident response plan in place.</p>
