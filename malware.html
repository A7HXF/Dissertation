            <h2>What is Malware?</h2>
            <p>Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any software intentionally designed to cause damage to a computer, server, client, or computer network. It can range from relatively harmless pranks to serious threats like stealing personal information, damaging files, or even rendering a computer or network unusable.</p>

            <h2>What Issues Can It Create?</h2>
            <p>Malware poses several significant threats to your digital security. It can slow down your computer's performance, rendering it sluggish and unresponsive. Additionally, malware may corrupt or delete important files, leading to potential data loss and disruption of your digital activities. Moreover, certain types of malware, such as spyware, can stealthily collect your sensitive personal information, putting you at risk of identity theft and financial fraud. Furthermore, malware can bombard you with incessant pop-up ads, interrupting your online experience and causing frustration. Ransomware, another malicious form of malware, can encrypt your files and demand payment for their release, resulting in financial losses and emotional distress. These threats highlight the critical importance of implementing robust security measures, such as regular software updates, cautious browsing habits, and the use of reputable antivirus software, to safeguard against the detrimental effects of malware.</p>
