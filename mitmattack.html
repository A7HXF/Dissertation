        <!-- Description of MitM Attacks -->
        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>What is a Man-in-the-Middle Attack?</h2>
            <p>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks occur when an attacker secretly relays and possibly alters the communication between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Main Issues Caused by MitM Attacks -->
        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>Main Issues Caused by MitM Attacks</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Data Interception:</strong> Sensitive information such as login credentials and personal data can be intercepted and stolen.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Eavesdropping:</strong> Attackers can gain unauthorized access to confidential conversations, compromising privacy.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Transaction Manipulation:</strong> Transactions can be altered by attackers, leading to financial losses or unauthorized fund transfers.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Loss of Integrity:</strong> The integrity of data is compromised, leading to mistrust in communication channels and systems.</p>

    <!-- Examples and Prevention of MitM Attacks -->
    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Examples of MitM Attacks</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Wi-Fi Eavesdropping:</strong> Attackers set up unsecured Wi-Fi networks in public places to intercept data from anyone who connects to them.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Email Hijacking:</strong> Attackers gain access to email accounts and intercept or alter communications to misdirect funds or gather sensitive information.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Attackers exploit insecure session tokens to take over a userâ€™s valid session on a website.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>DNS Spoofing:</strong> Redirecting users from legitimate websites to fraudulent ones to steal sensitive information.</p>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Prevention Tips for MitM Attacks</h2>
        <p>To  <strong>protect</strong> yourself from Man-In-The-Middle Attack, <strong>follow</strong> these essential steps:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Use Encrypted Connections:</strong> Always use HTTPS websites and secure Wi-Fi connections with strong encryption protocols like WPA2 or WPA3.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>VPN Usage:</strong> Use a reliable Virtual Private Network (VPN) when accessing public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Avoid Sharing Sensitive Information:</strong> Be cautious about sharing sensitive information over the internet, especially on unsecured or unknown networks.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Regularly Update Security Software:</strong> Keep all devices and security software updated to protect against known vulnerabilities that could be exploited in MitM attacks.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication:</strong> Use multi-factor authentication on all important accounts to add an extra layer of security, even if an attacker intercepts your login credentials.</p>
