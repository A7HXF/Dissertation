        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>What is Social Engineering?</h2>
            <p>Social engineering exploits human psychology, rather than technical hacking techniques, to gain access to buildings, systems, or data.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>Main Issues Caused by Social Engineering</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Unauthorised Access:</strong> Perpetrators gain entry to restricted areas or systems, leading to data breaches.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Loss of Sensitive Information:</strong> Critical information such as passwords and IDs can be manipulated out of employees or customers.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>System Compromise:</strong> Entire networks can be endangered due to manipulated insider actions.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Companies can suffer severe reputational harm affecting customer trust and business operations.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Examples of Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>Pretexting:</strong> Crafting a good pretext, or a fabricated scenario, to engage a targeted victim.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Baiting:</strong> Offering something enticing to an end-user, in exchange for login credentials or private information.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Phishing:</strong> Sending fake communications that appear to come from reputable sources, often directing users to enter personal information at a fake website.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Prevention Tips for Social Engineering</h2>
        <p>To <strong>protect</strong> yourself from Social Engineering Attacks, <strong>follow</strong> these essential steps:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Be Skeptical:</strong> Question the legitimacy of unexpected requests for sensitive information, even if they seem to come from within the company.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Verify Identities:</strong> Always confirm the identity of the person requesting information, especially if sensitive data is involved.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Educate Employees:</strong> Conduct regular training sessions to teach employees about the risks of social engineering and how to avoid them.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Secure Access Points:</strong> Implement strict policies and procedures for accessing sensitive data and areas within the organization.</p>
