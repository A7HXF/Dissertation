    <h1>Understanding Ransomware</h1>
    <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that encrypts a victim's files, making them inaccessible, and demands a ransom payment to restore access.</p>
    
    <div class="row top-row">
        <!-- Description of Ransomware -->
        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>What is Ransomware?</h2>
            <p>Ransomware is a type of malicious software that holds a user's data or entire system hostage until a ransom is paid. When ransomware infects a computer or network, it encrypts the victim's files, making them inaccessible, then the attackers demand payment.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Main Issues Caused by Ransomware -->
        <div class="threats-col">
            <h2>Main Issues Caused by Ransomware</h2>
            <p>1. <strong>Data Loss:</strong> Even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that data will be fully recoverable.</p>
            <p>2. <strong>Financial Cost:</strong> The financial impact can be significant, not just from the ransom paid but also from the downtime and loss of business.</p>
            <p>3. <strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Businesses can suffer long-term reputational damage, leading to loss of customers and business partners.</p>
            <p>4. <strong>Operational Disruption:</strong> Ransomware can halt operations, affecting services, manufacturing, and delivery processes.</p>

    <!-- Examples and Prevention of Ransomware -->
    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Examples of Ransomware</h2>
        <p>1. <strong>CryptoLocker:</strong> One of the first major ransomware threats that encrypted files and demanded cryptocurrency for decryption.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>WannaCry:</strong> Infected thousands of computers worldwide by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows operating systems.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Bad Rabbit:</strong> Disguised as a legitimate update, this ransomware spread through drive-by downloads to encrypt files.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Petya/NotPetya:</strong> Initially spread via tax software, it not only encrypted files but also overwrote the master boot record, making entire systems unusable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="prevention-section">
        <h2>Prevention Tips for Ransomware</h2>
        <p>To  <strong>protect</strong> yourself from Ransomware, <strong>follow</strong> these essential steps:</p>
        <p>1. <strong>Regular Backups:</strong> Keep regular backups of all important files in separate locations that are not connected to your network.</p>
        <p>2. <strong>Update and Patch Systems:</strong> Regularly update operating systems, software, and firmware on devices. Patch known vulnerabilities promptly.</p>
        <p>3. <strong>Use Reputable Antivirus Software:</strong> Maintain up-to-date antivirus software to detect and prevent ransomware attacks.</p>
        <p>4. <strong>Avoid Suspicious Links and Attachments:</strong> Train staff and individuals not to click on unsolicited links or open attachments in emails from unknown senders.</p>
        <p>5. <strong>Implement Security Best Practices:</strong> Use security features like whitelisting, application restrictions, and proper access controls to limit the spread of ransomware.</p>
